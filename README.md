## Recommended Wordlists

For better results, use comprehensive wordlists:

### SecLists
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
python subdomain_hunter.py -d example.com -w SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```

### Popular Wordlists
- **SecLists** - https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
  - `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt` (5K subdomains)
  - `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt` (20K subdomains)
  - `Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt` (110K subdomains)

```

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom DNS Servers

Edit `subdomain_hunter.py` and modify the DNS servers:
```python
self.resolver.nameservers = ['8.8.8.8', '1.1.1.1', '8.8.4.4']
```

### Thread Optimization

- **Fast networks**: Use 100-200 threads
- **Standard networks**: Use 50-100 threads (default: 50)
- **Slow networks**: Use 20-50 threads
```bash
python subdomain_hunter.py -d example.com -t 150
```

### Timeout Configuration

Adjust DNS timeout for slower connections:
```bash
python subdomain_hunter.py -d example.com --timeout 10
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Module not found: dns"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip install dnspython requests
```

### Issue: "Wordlist not found"
**Solution:**
Make sure the `wordlists/common.txt` file exists, or specify a custom wordlist:
```bash
python subdomain_hunter.py -d example.com -w /path/to/your/wordlist.txt
```

### Issue: Slow scanning
**Solution:**
- Increase thread count: `-t 100`
- Use smaller wordlists
- Check your internet connection

### Issue: No results found
**Solution:**
- Try increasing timeout: `--timeout 10`
- Use verbose mode: `-v`
- Check if the domain is valid and resolves
